# Energy
This project took data on renewable data consumption. The types of renewbale energies we looked at are biomass, geothermal, hydro, solar and wind. We were interested in examining the difference in renewable energy consuption in differemt states and overtime. Additionally, we looked at how the number of policies/incentives intended to promote renewable energy impacts renewable energy consuption. We found that there is a very weak correlation between the number of policies and total renewable data consumed. This is not what we had predicted. The weak correlation could be due to the effectiveness of individual policies, a time lag between when policies are put into place and when the impact is seen and heterogeneity across states. If I did this project again I would look at data on renewable production instead of renewable consumption because I predict that the policies will have a greater impact on production than consumption.

In this project we created a map to illustrate our data. This map was made using folium. To use this tool simply click on the dropdown to choose your year and energy type. You can then select a state for it's data.

In this project examining renewable energy consumption, meticulous attention was paid to ethical considerations throughout the entire process. Firstly, data collection adhered strictly to privacy regulations, ensuring the anonymity and consent of individuals whose data was utilized. Additionally, the team implemented robust measures to mitigate biases in the analysis, critically assessing algorithms and methodologies to uphold fairness and prevent discriminatory outcomes. Continuous monitoring and evaluation were conducted to identify and address any emerging ethical concerns, ensuring that the project's insights were ethically sound and socially responsible. This is especially important if that data is used to analyze the energy needs of an area to ensure that all people have access to clean energy.
